                you're right. but i want the peach really here.
                i want the fruit.
                i wish fruit wasn't so expensive currently. i saw a
                bag of grapes at the supermarket that was ten
                damn dollars. peaches also expensive
                right now. like, only thing fairly priced is "Red
                Delicious" apples which are basically Styrofoam,
                you know what im talking about.
                why is all the stuff that is bad for your organs like
                cheetos, sweet tarts, and ruffles so cheap, but the
                stuff that was supposed to come out of the
                ground and we just walked around as cavemen
                and picked that stuff, why that cost so much more.
                not that i dont like cheetos.
                i reallyyy love cheetos. i would literally kill people
                for chester cheetah, the cheetos mascot, he is so
                cool. but i want options too, chester. i want this
                guy to get his peaches. i want produce that is free
                as the sun it grows from. i want to bask in those
                rays with chester the cheetah enjoying fruit bowls.
                just two bros hanging out under the sun eating
                some tasty fruit. mother nature's candy.
                chester would tell me "it aint easy being cheesy,
                but this ain't too bad." i would laugh and call him
                a goofball. then we would do our secret
                handshake. 100%. i think this really shows that
                junk food and healthier lifestyles can co-exist.
                isn't that what being a georgia peach is all about?
                it is the economy and that really bad flu that
                happened like 2 years ago that is the problem.
                fruit isn't the problem. fruit should be shared.
                peaches being eaten for hours. i want a healthy
                snack. i want to return to nature. i want to freeze
                and eat some green grapes.
